# Custom Pathname

This is a page with a custom pathname. The path for this `.mdx` file is `src/pages/info.mdx`, however notice that the title of this page on the sidebar is 'Custom Pathname'. This is because the `path` frontmatter field has been set to 'Custom Pathname'. This page explains how to set it.

### Setting the path

To set the name of the page in the sidebar, you can add a `path` key to the frontmatter of the `.mdx` file. The value of the `path` key will be the name of the page in the sidebar.

```md
---
path: 'Custom Pathname'
---
```

### Setting the pathname for a directory

To set the name of a directory in the sidebar, you need to title the directory accordingly. For example, the `src/pages/more` directory has been named 'More' in the sidebar.

There is no special frontmatter required for directories. The name of the directory in the sidebar is the name of the directory in the `src/pages` directory.
