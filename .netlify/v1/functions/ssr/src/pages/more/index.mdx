# More Directory

This is a directory page. This specific directory contains three files, however only two of them are displayed in the sidebar. The `index.mdx` file is not displayed in the sidebar because you are currently viewing it. 

### Creating an index page for a directory

To create an index page for a directory, you need to create a file named `index.mdx` in the directory. This file will be the default page that is displayed when you navigate to the directory, and it will also be ommitted from the sidebar.

The `index.mdx` file can be created without any special frontmatter, only the layout frontmatter is required. The title of the page will be the name of the directory in the sidebar.

```md

layout: '@layouts/Layout.astro'

# Your content...
```

**Note: You cannot create a secondary directory within another directory.**
