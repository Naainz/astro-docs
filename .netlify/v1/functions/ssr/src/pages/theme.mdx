# Theme

So you're here to learn about themes, huh? Well, you've come to the right place. Themes are a way to customize the look and feel of your site. You can change the colors, fonts, and more. You can even create your own themes!

## Colors

One of the most common things people want to change about a website template, are the colors used. 

The colors currently being used in this template are:

- Primary: #004CA3, this is the main color used for links.
- Secondary: #E0EFFF, this is the color used for the selected sidebar item.

You can change these colors by editing the `src/components/Sidebar.astro` file. Simply use the find and replace feature in your code editor to change the colors, simply by searching for the hex code and replacing it with your own.
