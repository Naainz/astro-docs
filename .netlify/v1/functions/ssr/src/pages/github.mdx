# GitHub Links

On the sidebar, you can find a set of three buttons.

- **Questions? Give us feedback**: This button will take you to the GitHub Issues page, with a pre-filled issue title. You can use this to ask questions, report bugs, or give feedback.
- **Edit this page on GitHub**: This button will take you to the GitHub repository where the source code for this page is stored.
- **Scroll to top**: This button will take you to the top of the page.

### Edits

By default, the GitHub redirects will take you to the repository for this template `https://github.com/Naainz/astro-docs`. You can change this by updating the url in the `src/components/Sidebar.astro` file.

Simply find and replace the link `https://github.com/Naainz/astro-docs` with your own repository link.
