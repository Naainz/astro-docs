# Creating a new page

You can create a new page by creating a new `.mdx` file in the `src/pages` directory. 
By default, the name of the page in the sidebar will be the name of the `.mdx` file.
You can change this by reading the [Custom Pathname](/info) page.

### Creating a new .mdx file

To create a new page, you need to create a new `.mdx` file in the `src/pages` directory.

If a GUI is unavailable, please scroll down to the [NOGUI](#nogui) section.

1. Navigate to the `src/pages` directory.
2. Create a new `.mdx` file.
3. Add the following frontmatter to the top of the file:
```md
---
layout: '@layouts/Layout.astro'
---
```
4. Add your content below the frontmatter. This can be MDX, HTML, or a mix of both.


### Adding the page to the sidebar

To add the new page to the sidebar, you need to modify the `src/config/sidebar.json` file.

Instructions on how to do this can be found on the [Sidebar](/sidebar) page.

### NOGUI

If you are unable to use a GUI, you can create a new `.mdx` file using the command line.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command:
```sh
touch src/pages/page_name.mdx
```
(Replace `page_name` with the name of your new page)

4. Open the new `.mdx` file using `nano`
```sh
nano src/pages/page_name.mdx
```

5. Add the following frontmatter to the top of the file:
```md  
---
layout: '@layouts/Layout.astro'
---
```

6. Add your content below the frontmatter. This can be MDX, HTML, or a mix of both.
